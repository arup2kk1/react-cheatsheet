⚙️ Built-In JavaScript and React Features
1. fetch API (Built-In)
fetch: The modern way to make HTTP requests without additional libraries. It’s a built-in JavaScript API available in most browsers.
javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://api.example.com')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
2. Context API
Context API: React’s built-in state management solution for sharing data between components without props drilling.
javascript
Copy code
const MyContext = React.createContext();

const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(null);
  
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};
3. React Hooks (Built-In)
React Hooks: Special functions that let you use state and other React features in function components.
useState: To manage state within functional components.
useEffect: For performing side effects like data fetching or subscriptions.
useContext: For consuming context without needing to wrap components.
4. ES6+ JavaScript Features
Arrow Functions: Shorter syntax for functions.
javascript
Copy code
const sayHello = () => console.log('Hello!');
Destructuring: Extract values from arrays or properties from objects easily.
javascript
Copy code
const { name, age } = person;
Template Literals: Create strings with embedded variables.
javascript
Copy code
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
Modules (import/export): Reuse and organize code across files.
javascript
Copy code
export const myFunction = () => {};
import { myFunction } from './myFile';
🧩 More Useful Packages
Developer Tools & Build Systems
eslint: Helps maintain consistent code quality by catching errors and enforcing rules.
bash
Copy code
npm install eslint --save-dev
prettier: Automatically formats your code for consistency.
bash
Copy code
npm install prettier --save-dev
Utility Libraries
moment: A popular library for date and time manipulation (though date-fns is more modern).
bash
Copy code
npm install moment
uuid: Generate unique IDs for various purposes like keys and database records.
bash
Copy code
npm install uuid
Environment Management
dotenv: Manage environment variables via .env files, which is crucial for keeping sensitive information secure.
bash
Copy code
npm install dotenv
